<p>Write some code that takes two comma-separated integers as an input, and computes the sum of those integers. Write the sum integer to stdout.</p>
You'll get the two integers via STDIN in this format:

5,7

Correct STDOUT will look like this:

12

Remember that there may be additional hidden test cases that test your code's ability to handle edge cases. For example, the hidden test case here is:
STDIN:

-1,1

Expected STDOUT:

0
